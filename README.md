## Instruction

### ROTL_C
Left rotate one register (4 bytes) of C, only valid for register C.
`````

`````
ROTL_C is as readonly register, can be combined with other elements. ROTL_C is C 4 bytes left rotated.
`````
ROTL_C + 2 => A
`````
Example:
`````
0x101112131415161718191A1B1C1D1E1F202122232425262728292A2B2C2D2E2Fn => C
ROTL_C => A
0x1415161718191A1B1C1D1E1F202122232425262728292A2B2C2D2E2F10111213n: ASSERT
